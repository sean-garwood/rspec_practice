# types
# 1. Command - Changes the observable state, but does not return a value.
# 2. Query - Returns a result, but does not change the observable state.
# 3. Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning anything.
# 4. Looping Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning
#    anything, and stops when certain conditions are met.

# always test
# 1. Public Command or Public Query Methods should always be tested, because
# they are the public interface. Command Methods should test the method's action
# or side effect. Query Methods should test the method's return value.
# 2. Command or Query Methods that are inside a public script or looping script
# method should be tested. For the games that we are making, script and looping
# script methods are just a convenient way to call the methods needed to play a
# full game. Since these methods are required to play the game, they should be
# tested and made public (even if you previously made them private). Pretend
# that someone will be using your class to make their own game with customized
# text. Any method that they would need in their game should be part of the
# public interface and have test coverage.
# 3. Any method that sends a command message to another class should always test
# that those messages were sent.
# 4. A Looping Script Method should test the behavior of the method. For
# example, that it stops when certain conditions are met.

# don't test:
# 1. You do not have to test #initialize if it is only creating instance
# variables. However, if you call methods inside the initialize method, you
# might need to test #initialize and/or the inside methods. In addition, you
# will need to stub any inside methods because they will be called when you
# create an instance of the class.
# 2. You do not have to test methods that only contain 'puts' or 'gets'
# because they are well-tested in the standard Ruby library.
# 3. Private methods do not need to be tested because they should have test
# coverage in public methods. However, as previously discussed, you may have
# some private methods that are called inside a script or looping script method;
# these methods should be tested publicly.

# summary
# 1. Command Method -> Test the change in the observable state
# 2. Query Method -> Test the return value
# 3. Method with Outgoing Command -> Test that a message is sent
# 4. Looping Script Method -> Test the behavior of the method
